# thc-pptp-bruter
**THC-PPTP-Bruter** is a tool used for brute-forcing the credentials of PPTP (Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol) VPNs. It is included in Kali Linux and is useful for testing the strength of passwords used in PPTP VPNs.

### Installation

THC-PPTP-Bruter is typically pre-installed in Kali Linux. If not, you can install it using:

```bash
sudo apt install thc-pptp-bruter
```

### Basic Syntax

The basic syntax for using THC-PPTP-Bruter is:

```bash
thc-pptp-bruter <target_ip> <username> <password_list>
```

### Common Options

- **-u, --user**: Specify the username.
- **-f, --file**: Specify the password list file.
- **-h, --help**: Display help information.

### Usage Examples

#### 1. Brute-forcing PPTP Login

To perform a brute-force attack on a PPTP VPN, you can use:

```bash
thc-pptp-bruter -u username -f /path/to/passwords.txt 192.168.1.100
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Trying password: password123
Success: username:password123
```

This output indicates that the tool successfully found the credentials for the specified username.

#### 2. Using a List of Users and Passwords

If you have a list of usernames and passwords, you can specify them accordingly:

```bash
thc-pptp-bruter -f /path/to/passwords.txt -u /path/to/usernames.txt 192.168.1.100
```

**Expected Output:**

```
Trying user: admin with password: admin123
Success: admin:admin123
```

This output shows that the tool successfully authenticated using the specified username and password.

### Important Considerations

- **Legal Use**: Always ensure you have permission to test the systems you are targeting. Unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.
- **Performance**: The speed of brute-forcing can vary based on network conditions and the strength of the passwords being tested.

### Conclusion

THC-PPTP-Bruter is a powerful tool for testing PPTP VPN authentication. By using the appropriate commands and options, you can effectively identify weak passwords in your VPN configuration. Always use this tool responsibly and within the bounds of the law.

- **-P <password_file>**: Specifies a file containing passwords to try.
- **-v**: Increases the verbosity level.
- **-t <threads>**: Sets the number of concurrent threads to use.

### Examples

#### 1. Brute-Force PPTP VPN Login

To brute-force a PPTP VPN login using a list of usernames and passwords:

```
thc-pptp-bruter -U /path/to/usernames.txt -P /path/to/passwords.txt 192.168.1.100
```

**Expected Output:**

```
THC-PPTP-Bruter 0.1.3 (c) 2010 by THC

**THC-PPTP-Bruter** is a brute-force tool specifically designed to attack PPTP VPN endpoints, exploiting vulnerabilities in the Microsoft MSChapV2 authentication protocol. This tool is included in Kali Linux and is useful for testing the security of PPTP VPNs.

### How to Use THC-PPTP-Bruter

1. **Installation**: If it's not already installed, you can install it using the following command:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install thc-pptp-bruter
   ```

2. **Basic Command Structure**:
   The basic syntax for using THC-PPTP-Bruter is:
   ```bash
   thc-pptp-bruter [options] <remote host IP>
   ```

3. **Common Options**:
   - `-u <user>`: Specify the username (default is `administrator`).
   - `-w <file>`: Specify a wordlist file containing passwords (default is standard input).
   - `-p <n>`: Specify the PPTP port (default is `1723`).
   - `-n <n>`: Set the number of parallel tries (default is `5`).
   - `-l <n>`: Limit the number of passwords per second (default is `100`).
   - `-v`: Enable verbose output for debugging.

### Example Usage

#### Example 1: Basic Brute-Force Attack
To perform a brute-force attack against a PPTP VPN endpoint, you can use the following command:
```bash
thc-pptp-bruter -u admin -w /path/to/passwords.txt 192.168.1.100
```
In this command:
- `-u admin`: Specifies the username `admin`.
- `-w /path/to/passwords.txt`: Points to a file containing potential passwords.
- `192.168.1.100`: The target IP address of the PPTP VPN.

```
Here, `-n 10` sets the number of parallel tries to `10`.

**Expected Output**:
```
Trying password: letmein
Success: admin:letmein
```

### Important Notes
- THC-PPTP-Bruter exploits a weakness in Microsoftâ€™s anti-brute force implementation, allowing it to attempt a high number of password guesses per second, making it effective against poorly secured PPTP VPNs [[1]](https://www.kali.org/tools/thc-pptp-bruter/).
- Always ensure you have permission to test the systems you are targeting, as unauthorized access is illegal and unethical.

### Conclusion
THC-PPTP-Bruter is a powerful tool for testing the security of PPTP VPNs. By using the appropriate options and wordlists, you can effectively assess the strength of the passwords protecting these services.
